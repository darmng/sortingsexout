<p>“We must spin our categories like tetrominos.<br />
We must turn our ontologies downside-in and upside-out.<br />
We must seek monsters and cyborgs in the borderlands and be mindful to watch for black swans.<br />
We can’t make change unless we’re playful, since learning means letting go.”<br /><br />
—	Peter Morville; Intertwingled (2014), p. 79.
